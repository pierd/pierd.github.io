> "What is he like?"
> "The physique of a Messiah. Bot too clever to believe in God or be convinced of his own mission. And too sensitive, even if he were convinced, to carry it out. His muscles would like to act and his feelings would like to believe; but his nerve endings and his cleverness won't allow it."
> "So I suppose he's very unhappy."
> "So unhappy that he has to laugh like a hyena."
> "Does he know he laughs like a hyena?"
> "Knows and is rather proud of it. Even makes epigrams about it. 'I'm the man who won't take yes for an answer.'"

> Faith is sometimes very different from belief. Belief is the systematic taking of unanalyzed words much too seriously. Paul's words, Mohammed's words, Marx's words, Hitler's words - people take them too seriously, and what happens? What happens is the senseless ambivalence of history - sadism versus duty, or (incomparably worse) sadism as duty; devotion counterbalanced by organized paranoia; sisters of charity selflessly tending the victims of their own church's inquisitors and crusaders. Faith, on the contrary, can never be taken too seriously. For fact we are, to forget the belief-intoxicated Manichee in Good Geing, Give us this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.

> The little nurse gave him his injection of antibiotic, then, from one of the bottles in her bag, stirred a tablespoonful of some greenish liquid into half a glass of water.
> "Drink this."
> It tasted like one of those herbal concoctions that health-food enthusiasts substitute for tea.

> "So you think our medicine's pretty primitive?"
> "That's the wrong word. It isn't primitive. It's fifty percent terrific and fifty percent nonexistent. Marvelous antibiotics - but absolutely no methods for increasing resistance, so that antibiotics won't be necessary. Fantastic operations - but when it comes to teaching people the way of going through life without having to be chopped up, absolutely nothing. And it's the same all along the line. Alpha Plus for patching you up when you've started to fall apart; but Delta Minus for keeping you healthy. Apart from sewerage systems and synthetic vitamins, you don't seem to do anything at all about prevention. And yet you've got a proverb: prevention is better than cure."
> "But cure," said Will, "is so much more dramatic than prevention. And for the doctors it's also a lot more profitable."
