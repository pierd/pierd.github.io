I do agree that ECS makes sense, especially for game development. But I also [agree with Jonathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t1K66dMhWk) that it's not that Rust pushes you into ECS, ECS just gives you a way to escape the borrow checker.

Time to make [a game](https://github.com/deasilgame/deasil) using ECS in Rust.
