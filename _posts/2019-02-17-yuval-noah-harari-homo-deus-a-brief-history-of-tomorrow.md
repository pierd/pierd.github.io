> For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.
> - *Chapter 1 - The New Human Agenda*

> People today imagine the ancient temple in Jerusalem as a kind of big synagogue where priests clad in snow-white robes welcomed devout pilgrims, melodious choirs sang psalms and incense perfumed the air. In reality, it looked much more like a cross between a slaughterhouse and a barbecue joint than a modern synagogue. The pilgrims did not come empty-handed. They brought with them a never-ending stream of sheep, goats, chickens and other animals, which were sacrificed at the god's altar and then cooked and eaten. The psalm-singing choirs could hardly be heard over the bellowing and bleating of calves and kids. Priests in bloodstained outfits cut the victims' throats, collected the gushing blood in jars and spilled it over the alter. The perfume of incense mixed with the odours of congealed blood and roasted meat, while swarms of black flies buzzed just about everywhere (see for example, Numbers 28, Deuteronomy 12, and 1 Samuel 2). A modern Jewish family that celebrates a holiday by having a barbecue on their front lawn is much closer to the spirit of biblical times than an orthodox family that spends the time studying scriptures in a synagogue.

> Religion is *anything* that confers superhuman legitimacy on human social structures. It legitimises human norms and values by arguing that they reflect superhuman laws.
> - *Chapter 5 - The Odd Couple*

---

> Liberals, communists and followers of other modern creeds dislike describing their system as a 'religion', because they identify religion with superstitions and supernatural powers. If you tell communists or liberals that they are religious, they think you accuse them of blindly beliving in groundless pipe dreams. In fact, it means only that they believe in some system of moral laws that wasn't invented by humans, but which humans must nevertheless obey. As far as we know, all human societies believe in this.

> Religion has nothing to say about science and science should keep its mouth shut concerning religious convictions.
> - *Chapter 5 - The Odd Couple*

---

> When we leave the ethereal sphere of philosophy and observe historical realities, we find that religious stories almost always include three parts:
> 1. Ethical judgements, such as 'human life is sacred'.
> 2. Factual statements, such as 'human life begins at the moment of conception'.
> 3. A conflation of the ethical judgements with the factual statements, resulting in practical guidelines such as 'you should never allow abortion, even a single day after conception'.
> Science has no authority or ability to refute or corroborate the ethical judgements religions make. But scientists do have a lot to say about religious factual statements. For example, biologists are more qualified than priests to answer factual questions such as 'Do human fetuses have a nervous system one week after conception? Can they feel pain?'

> Premodern games such as chess assumed a stagnant economy. You begin a game of chess with sixteen pieces, and you never finish a game with more. In rare cases a pawn may be transformed into a queen, but you cannot produce new pawns, nor can you upgrade your knights into tanks. So chess players never have to think about investment. In contrast, many modern board games and computer games revolve around investment and growth.

> Most of the presidents, ministers and CEOs who run the world are very rational people. Why are they willing to take such a gamble? Maybe because they don't think they are gambling on their own personal future. Even if bad comes to worse and science cannot hold off the deluge, engineers could still build a hi-tech Noah's Ark for the upper caste, while leaving billions of others to drown. The belief in this hi-tech Ark is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of humandkind and of the entire ecosystem. People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who believe in a heavenly after life should not be given nuclear weapons.

> According to humanism, humans must draw from within their inner experiences not only the meaning of their own lives, but also the meaning of the entire universe. This is the primary commandment humanism has given us: create meaning for a meaningless world.
> - *Chapter 7 - The Humanist Revolution*

---

> Interestingly enough, today even religious zealots adopt this humanistic discourse when they want to influence public opinion. For example, every year for the past decade the Isreali LGBT community holds a gay parade in the streets of Jerusalem. It is a unique day of harmony in this conflict-riven city, because it is the one occasion when religious Jews, Muslims and Christians suddenly find a common cause - they all fume in accord against the gay parade. What's really interesting, though, is the argument they use. They don't say, 'You shouldn't hold a gay parade because God forbids homosexuality.' Rather, they explain to every available microphone and TV camera that 'seeing a gay parade passing through the holy city of Jerusalem hurts our feelings. Just as gay people want us to respect their feelings, they should respect ours.'

> ..., if some multinational corporation want to know whether it lives up to its 'Don't be evil' motto, it need only to take a look at its bottom line. If it makes loads of money, it means that millions of people like its products, which implies that it is a force for good. If someone objects and says that people might make the wrong choice, he will be quickly reminded that the customer is always right, and that human feelings are the source of all meaning and authority.

> When Nietzsche declared that God is dead, this is what he meant. At least in the West, God has become and abstract idea that some accept and others reject, but it makes little difference either way. In the Middle Ages, without a god I had no source of political, moral and aesthetic authority. I could not tell what was right, good or beautiful.
> - *Chapter 7 - The Humanist Revolution*

---

> More than a century after Nietzsche pronounced Him dead, God seems to be making a comeback. But this is a mirage. God *is* dead - it just takes a while to get rid of the body.

> In fact, our belief in free will results from faulty logic. When a biochemical chain reaction makes me desire to press the right switch, I feel that I really want to press the right switch. And this is true. I really want to press it. Yet people erroneously jump to the conclusion that if I want to press it, I *choose* to want to. This is of course false. I don't *choose* my desires. I only *feel* them, and act accordingly.
> - *Chapter 8 - The Time Bomb in the Laboratory*

> Next time a thought pops up in your mind, stop and ask yourself, 'Why did I think this particular thought? Did I decide a minute ago to think this thought, and only then did I think it? Or did it just arise in my mind, without my permission or instruction? If I am indeed the master of my thoughts and decisions, can I decide not to think about anything at all for the next sixty seconds?' Just try, and see what happens.

> A recent study commissioned by Google's nemesis - Facebook - has indicated that already today the Facebook algorithm is a better judge of human personalities and dispositions even than people's friends, parents and spouses. The study was conducted on 86,220 volunteers who have a Facebook account and who completed a hundred item personality questionnaire. The Facebook algorithm predicted the volunteers' answers based on monitoring their Facebook Likes - which webpages, images and clips they tagged with the Like button. The more Likes, the more accurate the predictions. The algorithm's predictions were compared with those of work colleagues, friends, family members and spouses. Amazingly, the algorithm needed a set of only ten Likes in order to outperform the predictions of work colleagues. It needed seventy Likes to outperform friends, 150 Likes to outperform family members and 300 Likes to outperform spouses. In other words, if you happen to have clicked 300 Likes on your Facebook account, the Facebook algoritm can predict your opinions and desires better than your husband or wife!

> In the high days of European imperialism, conquistadors and merchants bought entire islands and countries in exchange for coloured beads. In the twenty-first century our personal data is probably the most valuable resource most humans still have to offer, and we are giving it to the tech giants in exchange for email services and funny cat videos.

> 1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?
> 2. What's more valuable - intelligence or consciousness?
> 3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?
