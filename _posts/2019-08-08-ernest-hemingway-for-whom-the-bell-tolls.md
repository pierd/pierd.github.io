> But I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.

> "Men. It is a shame to us women that we make them. [...]"

> "Ours?" Anselmo asked. <br/> <br/>
> "They seem so," Robert Jordan said but knew that at that height you never could be sure. They could be an evening patrol of either side. But you always said pursuit planes were ours because it made people feel better. Bombers were another matter. <br/> <br/>
> Anselmo evidently felt the same. "They are ours," he said. "I recognize them. They are *Moscas*."
> - *Chapter Three*

> "Listen," the woman said. "I am no coward, but I see things very clearly in the early morning and I think there are many that we know that are alive now who will never see another Sunday." <br/> <br/>
> "In what day are we?" <br/> <br/>
> "Sunday." <br/> <br/>
> "*Qu√© va*," said Robert Jordan. "Another Sunday is very far. If we see Wednesday we are all right. But I do not like to hear thee talk like this." <br/> <br/>
> "Everyone needs to talk to some one," the woman said. "Before we had religion and other nonsense. Now for everyone there should be some one to whom one can speak frankly, for all valor that one could have one becomes very alone."

> Maria was very hard on his bigotry. So far she had not affected his resolution but he would much prefer not to die. He would abandon a hero's or a martyr's end gladly. He did not want to make a Therrnopylse, nor be Horatius at any bridge, nor be the Dutch boy with his finger in that dyke. No. He would like to spend some time with Maria. That was the simplest expression of it. He would like to spend a long, long time with her.
> - *Chapter Thirteen*

> This was the greatest gift that he had, the talent that fitted him for war; that ability not to ignore but to despise whatever bad ending there could be. This quality was destroyed by too much responsibility for others or the necessity of undertaking something ill planned or badly conceived. For in such things the bad ending, failure, could not be ignored. It was not simply a possibility of harm to one's self, which *could* be ignored. He knew he himself was nothing, and he knew death was nothing. He knew that truly, as truly as he knew anything. In the last few days he had learned that he himself, with another person, could be everything. But inside himself he knew that this was the exception. That we have had, he thought. In that I have been most fortunate. That was given to me, perhaps, because I never asked for it. That cannot be taken away nor lost. But that is over and done with now on this morning and what there is to do now is our work.
> - *Chapter Thirty-Nine*
