I guess every blog needs a *why* page. So here's the one for this one.

I would like this to be a mixture of information about myself, my interests, projects and in general things I find interesting. It would be cool if it can serve as a kind of portfolio.

I don't expect to have any audience but if you stumble upon this little piece of Internet - say hello.

Cheers, Kuba
