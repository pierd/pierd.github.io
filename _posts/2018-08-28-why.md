I guess every blog needs a *why* page. So here's the one for this one.

I would like this to be a mixture of information about myself, my interests, projects and in general things I find interesting. It would be cool if it can serve as a kind of portfolio.

I don't expect to have any audience but if you stumble upon this little piece of Internet - say hello.

The dates are kind of fuzzy here. I have loads of notes and I'm turning them into posts and backdating to what I think is appropriate (date of the note, date when I finished given book). Also some posts evolve (or are evolving because this is the first one I'm updating) with time, I won't change the date in this case - if there's plenty of new material then I'll just create a new one and reference the old one. If for whatever reason you're interested in how this thing was changing in time then you can always check the underlying [repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}).

Cheers, Kuba
