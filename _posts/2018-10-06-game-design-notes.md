Random Notes from [Game Design Foundations 1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/game-design-foundations-1-ideas-core-loops-and-goals). Highly recommended!

## What is game design?

Game designer is like a architect - creates plans for others to execute

```
designer = architect
programmer = builder
artist = interior designer
```

Designers create rules.

> Innovation is the key for your game to stand out.

Hint: Keep game diary and note your game ideas.

> Games need conflict

## Core of a game

What the game is about?

Every single feature or system should make the core stronger! Feature that don't link to the core should be cut.

Pillars - what? how? why? explains the core in a bit more details - a kind of guide to focus on to make supporting the core easier.

### Core loop (core in motion)

Core Progression Loop - actions that join together and progress in the game
(in RPG: get xp -> kill bigger monsters -> get even more xp).

Core Skill Loop - players progress by developing their skills.

> Players want to progress in a game - that's the core loop

### Feature set

Things players can do in a game.

Innovation - a new way to do something in a game.

> If there's nothing unique in a game - why make it?

> Try to create one innovative thing that no other games like yours have done before.

Fight Feature Creep - select only the ones that make the core stronger and you have time to implement.

> Revisit your core statement oftem
If you change the core - revisit the features!

## Game Atoms

- player
- game view
    - information
    - camera
- game state
    - hidden / visible to all players
    - what should player know about the game state
    - what should be hidden

Mechanic - a set of rules that produce a certain outcome.

Game Dynamic - what happens to Mechanics when we add players.

One designs mechanics to achieve certain dynamics, but others will be a surprise.

```
Mechanics <- Dynamics <- System
```

A designer usually wants certain system and to achieve some dynamics. So a designer develops mechanics hoping to achieve the dynamics and systems.

## Goals

Goals shouldn't be hidden - players should know what to do.

Type of goals:
- Short term - 20 minutes/1 session
- Medium term - 2+ sessions
- Long term - endgame goals
