> Fiction is a lie that tells us true things...
> - *Introduction by Neil Gaiman*

> "You weren't there, you didn't see," he said. "There must be something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing."
> "she was simple-minded."
> "She was a rational as you and I, more so perhaps, and we burned her."
> - *One: The Hearth and the Salamander*

> "Last night I thought about all that kerosene I've used in the past ten years. And I thought about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man hand to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them on paper. And I'd never even thought that thought before." He got out of bed.
> "It took some man a lifetime maybe to put some of his thoughts down, looking around at the world and life and then I come along in two minutes and boom! it's all over."
> "Let me alone," said Mildred. "I didn't do anything."
> "Let you alone! That's all very well, but how can I leave myself alone? We need not to let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were *really* bothered? About something important, about something real?"
> - *One: The Hearth and the Salamander*

> The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean.
> - *One: The Hearth and the Salamander*

> We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone *made* equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute.

> The girl? She was a time bomb. The family had been feeding her subconscious, I'm sure, from what I saw of her school record. She didn't want to know *how* a thing was done, but *why*. That can be embarrassing. You ask Why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girl's better off dead.
> - *One: The Hearth and the Salamander*

> "Leisure."
> "Oh, but we've plenty of off hours."
> "Off hours, yes. But time to think? If you're not driving a hundred miles an hour, at a clip where you can't think of anything else but the danger, then you're playing some game or sitting in some room where you can't argue with the four-wall televisor. Why? The televisor is 'real'. It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It *must* be right. It *seems* so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasn't time to protest, 'What nonsense!'"
> - *Two: The Sieve and the Sand*

> "I'm not thinking. I'm just doing like I'm told, like always. You said get the money and I got it. I didn't really think of it myself. When do I start working things out on my own?"
> "You've started already, by saying what you just said. You'll have to take me on faith."
> "I took the others on faith!"
> "Yes, and look where we're headed. You'll have to travel blind for awhile. Here's my arm to hold onto."
> "I don't want to change sides and just be *told* what to do. There's not reason to change if I do that."
> "You're wise already!"
> - *Two: The Sieve and the Sand*

> "I plunk the children in school nine days out of ten. I put up with them when they come home three days a month; it's not bad at all. You heave them into the 'parlor' and turn the switch. It's like washing clothes; stuff laundry in and slam the lid."
