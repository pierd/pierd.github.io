The company I work for was nice enough to provide me with an entry to [PyCon AU 2018](https://2018.pycon-au.org/) conference. I've spent three days there (Aug 24-26).

*Update for my grannies: people are nice, food is average, the weather was subpar but I'm having a good time.*

Here are the talk that I've attended + some random notes.

PyCon AU organisers were nice enough to publish all videos on YouTube - you can find them [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyConAU).

# Friday August 24

## [Agloe - What the map makers of the 1930s can teach us about protecting our data in 2018](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/41799-agloe-what-the-map-makers-of-the-1930s-can-teach-us-about-protecting-our-data-in-2018/)
Canary tokens - when opened they trigger an alarm.

Few ideas where they can be placed:
- a link in an email ("Here is a very important document") - detect if an email account was compromised
- an email address in DB - detect if DB data was leaked
- AWS credentials (`~/.aws/credentials`) - detect if a machine was compromised
- an entry in `~/.ssh/config` - detect if your machine was compromised

Canary tokens don't provide security by themselves but they have very good signal to noise ratio.

## [Privacy Preserving Record Linkage](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/44892-privacy-preserving-record-linkage/)
First of all I like the history part on [Brian's website](https://brian.thorne.link) - I'm thinking about stealing the idea.

The talk itself - interesting problem I wasn't aware of.

The main idea: splitting names (or other details) into N-grams and put them into bloom filter to anonymise the data but perserve the basic properties that allow for Record Linkage.

Libraries available on GitHub:
- [clkhash](https://github.com/n1analytics/clkhash)
- [anonlink](https://github.com/n1analytics/anonlink)

## [Security Architecture from Ancient Times](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/42329-security-architecture-from-ancient-times/)
I highly recommend watching this one. Key takeaways:

Desirable control attributes:
- Individual control:
    - simple
    - strong
    - self-defending
- Multiple controls:
    - fail independently
    - diverse
    - mutually supporting

## [Learning from the mistakes that even big projects make](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/41704-learning-from-the-mistakes-that-even-big-projects-make/)
Interesting but TBH I have not made any notes

## [Demystifying LoRaWAN with PyCom](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/44704-demystifying-lorawan-with-pycom/)
Interesting but TBH I have not made any notes

## [Workplace Environment Sensing with Python](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45376-workplace-environment-sensing-with-python/)
A really cool project. I liked the extra usage as a marker for interruption acceptance.

## [Automating Your Home with Python, Raspberry Pi and Homekit](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45170-automating-your-home-with-python-raspberry-pi-and-homekit/)
[pyhap](https://github.com/condemil/pyhap) + Raspberry Pi + AirCon + iPhone = **MAGIC**

## [Education Seminar Student Showcase](https://2018.pycon-au.org/education-showcase)
I watched only the first 2 presentations before heading to The Panel. From what I've seen it's Machine Learning all the way.

1. Playing noughts and crosses with the power of Machine Learning. Inspired by [*MENACE: the pile of matchboxes which can learn*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU).
2. Optimising flash cards style learning with Machine Learning (finding good spot for repetition ~ 40% recall).

## [The Panel](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45001-the-panel/)
Interesting but TBH I have not made any notes

## [Remote First, Not Second Best](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45291-remote-first-not-second-best/)
I wanted to listen to this talk since I worked remotely for few years.

> “Culture eats methodology for breakfast”

Right tools are crucial. Synchronous communication is overrated and technology is not there yet anyway.

## [All in the Timing: Side-Channel Attacks](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45261-all-in-the-timing-sidechannel-attacks/)
This one got me really interested. I'm going to try a timing attack in practice - stay tuned!

Few side-channel attacks mentioned in the talk:
- timing attack against Python string comparison
- exploiting gzip to guess CSRF token behind HTTPS (if you can make a server include a string you control then you can try guessing some other information basing on how it affects the result size - if you match something that is included in the response then the resulting gzipped response will be smaller)
- DoS attack by making Python dicts slow (making hashes collide) - first *fixed* by introducing a random factor generated on process start, then [fixed again](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0456/)
- [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability))

## [Why you should care about types: How Python typing helped my team scale](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45224-why-you-should-care-about-types-how-python-typing-helped-my-team-scale/)
Types are good. Types are pythonic.

Projects:
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) - type analisys
- [Monkeytype](https://github.com/Instagram/MonkeyType) - detecting types in runtime to add them to source code

Duck typing? [Protocols](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/)!

Type information for Standard Library? [Typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed)!

## [Creepy, frivolous and beautiful art made with machines](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45247-creepy-frivolous-and-beautiful-art-made-with-machines/)
[Just watch it on YouTube!](https://youtu.be/Ldz6io2_pOE)

## [Write Perfect* Code First Time, Every Time](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45378-write-perfect-code-first-time-every-time/)
Visual Studio Code Python extension has breakpoints/stepping/debug console/etc.

It has real debug console (one can execute code in a running process). Internally it uses [Python Tools for Visual Studio debug server](https://github.com/Microsoft/ptvsd).

Setup costs :(

Alternatives to VSC: pdb (plain old Python debugger), spyder (full blown Python IDE).

## [Reflections on the Creative Process - Illustrated with Watercolour Painting](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45226-reflections-on-the-creative-process-illustrated-with-watercolour-painting/)
The Creative Process:
1. Planning - all the ideas how it’s going to come out
2. Stress - is it really coming out as expected
3. De-escalate - relax, think, be in a moment
4. Decision moment - give up or keep going?
5. Commit to the decision - life is short keep going
6. Finishing touches -> stop when it’s good (don’t overdo)
7. Allow appreciation time

Big life perspective: make a plan (prepare for bad events)

Key takeways:
- Reflect on how you work, not just coding
- Self soothe
- Talk to others about how you feel (it’s okay to do this!)
- Know that your community of people are willing to help and support you
- [Acceptance and commitment therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy)

## [FP demystified](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45075-fp-demystified/)
Functional Programming in Python live in Jupyter Notebook!

Inspired by [Professor Frisby](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript).

Source code available [here](https://github.com/3kwa/frisby).

## [Colossal Cave Adventure in Python... in the browser!](https://2018.pycon-au.org/talks/45228-colossal-cave-adventure-in-python-in-the-browser/)
*Adventure* is a really old (probably the first) text adventure game implemented in Fortran IV. Chris created a Fortran IV interpreter to run it and he hooked it up together behind Twillio API. At time of writing it was accessible via text message on +61 488 847 569 or +1 (669) 238-3683.

He also put it [online](https://swenson.github.io/adventurejs/) in a Python interpreter in JavaScript (yes, Fortran IV in Python in JavaScript) - hilariously slow.

That's all folks! See you next year...
